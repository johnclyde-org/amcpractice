## Proof

We tile the rectangle as so:
[Figure 1] (where the corners are black)

Consequently, there is at least 1 rectangle with odd side length and black corners. (**Lemma 1**)

### Proof of Lemma 1:

Assume the contrary for the sake of contradiction. Then there are only rectangles with even side lengths, which have an equal amount of white and black squares, or rectangles with odd side lengths and white corners, which have more white squares than black squares. However, there has to be more black squares than white squares, contradiction.

By **Lemma 1**, we need to prove that the odd rectangle satisfies those restrictions. We do this by numbering the rectangle like so:

[Figure 2]

We know by **Lemma 1** that the corners can be written as \((2a-1, 2b-1)\) and \((2c+1, 2d+1)\) or \((2a, 2b)\). In the case that the corners are both \(0 \mod 2\), then the distances are all odd. (justification because *illegible*) In the case that the corners are both \(1 \mod 2\), then the distances are all odd.
